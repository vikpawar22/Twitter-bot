In our Twitter Bot we have extracted data from Twitter into 3 tables that is Twitter_User, Twitter_Details_ Twitter_Tags.  

In Twitter User table, we are extracting the twitter handle information of 10 users. In Twitter Details table, we are extracting the tweets tweeted by the user. In Twitter Tags table, we are extracting tags present in each tweet.  

We are connecting the Twitter bot tables with our NBA Stats' tables. The Player name mentioned in Twitter Details table is connected to the Player Table. Each PLayer has its player stats and a team. Eaxh Team has a coach and each home staium as shown in the ER Diagram.
